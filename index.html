	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p> 23 year old from Romania I am pursuing a master's degree in Management & Informatics at Universita della Svizzera Italiana, in Lugano, Switzerland. Currently on an exchange semester in UZH in ZÃ¼rich..</p>
	<p> The blog contains posts about conferences I attend, interesting insights from university, as well as book reviews and pretty much everything related to personal development. </p>
	<p> In my spare time, I love playing tennis and skiing, reading philosophy, literature, specialty books (predominantly economic theory, marketing,entrepreneurship & psychology), traveling and photography (and track it on my <a href="http://finding-calypso.tumblr.com/"> photo blog </a>).</p>
	<p> Feel free to take a look at my <a href="/StancuBianca_CV.pdf">resume</a> :). </p>
