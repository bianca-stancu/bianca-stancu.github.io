	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p> 23 year old from Romania, currently studying in Lugano, Switzerland. I am pursuing a master's degree in Management & Informatics.</p>
	<p> The blog, recently started (February 2018) contains (or will contain) posts about conferences I attend, interesting insights from university, as well as book reviews and pretty much everything related to personal development. </p>
	<p> In my spare time, I love playing tennis and skiing, reading philosophy, literature, specialty books (predominantly economic theory, marketing,entrepreneurship & psychology), traveling and photography (and track it on my <a href="http://finding-calypso.tumblr.com/"> photo blog </a>).</p>
	<p> Feel free to take a look at my <a href="/pdf_js/web/viewer.html?file=CV_Bianca_Stancu.pdf">resume</a> :). </p>
