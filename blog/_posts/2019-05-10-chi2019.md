I attended this year's ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) conference, in Glasgow, Scotland. I was there together with my supervisors my work as an UROP research internship at Universita della Svizzera Italiana in the summer of 2018. We were presenting a demo of our work together, *Movie+: Towards Exploring Social Effects of Emotional Fingerprints for Video Clips and Movies*. You can check it out [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3290607.3313261).

It was a great experience, and I had a lot of fun checking out what people are working on and talking to people with similar or completely new and interesting work.
