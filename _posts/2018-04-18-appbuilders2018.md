My university offered a couple of grants to participate at the 2018 edition of [AppBuilders](https://www.appbuilders.ch/), held in Lugano. My application was successfull, so I got a chance to take part of this really cool event.
I mostly attended the talks on the Android side, as well as nice conceptual talks about how to improve MVC for example. All in all, content was various and good and everyone put a lot of effort in delivering good presentations. Also got a chance to witness the Dean of my Faculty holding a great talk about system scalability. 
Many thanks to USI for giving a handful of us the chance to participate at this year's AppBuilders and congrats to the organizers.
