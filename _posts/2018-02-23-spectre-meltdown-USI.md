Yesterday I attended the "Meltdown, Spectre, and the hidden side of a computer's processor" held at my university USI in Lugano, 
held by Paolo Bonzini, Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat. I had previously attended a talk on the two vulnerabilities
at this year's FOSDEM, in Brussels, but it was a more theoretical presentation with less actual insight on mitigation and the implications
of Meltdown and Spectre. I had a much better understanding of some concepts after the presentation and enjoyed the approach.
The follow-up was diving into googling various notions and getting caught up in this for a couple of hours.
I discovered with quite a delay the great talks that are organized at my university, but I'll probably be abusing that more often from now on.
