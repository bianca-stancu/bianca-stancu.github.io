The following blog post covers a series of charts and transformations that can be performed with **ggplot2**.

## Preparation
For the purpose of this analysis, the dataset used, *Task Completion Times on Mobile Device by Display Size and Task Difficulty*, presents the following setup:
* IV1: treatment
* IV2: display
* IV3: task
* DV: task time


## Graphs
### Box-plot
```
geom_boxplot()
```
Below is a box plot using as x-axis the Task and the two colours as fill to encode the two different displays:

 ### Violin
 An equivalent violin plot was done using:
 ```
 geom_violin()
 ```

 The graphs are now split into two different panels per display due to:
 ```
 facet_grid(. ~ Display)
 ```

### Beeswarm
Using **ggbeeswarm**:
```
geom_beeswarm(cex=3)
```
Below is the beeswarm plot for each type of display, split by tasks:

### Histogram
Using:
```
geom_histogram()
```

Below is a histogram for the dependent variable for all combinations of tasks and  display:

### Densitiy plots
Using:
```
geom_density()
```

Below is a density plot for the display, shown by task:
