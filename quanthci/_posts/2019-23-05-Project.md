A useful resource for future reference can also be the team project. It was a lot of hard work and a long process into understanding the details of such a complex task such as replicating a study, as well as team working skills. Overall, I had a great time with a great team!

The project contains two R scripts that contain relevant data analysis steps and can be used in the future:
* The data analysis replicating the experiment
* A demographics analysis of the participants

The full code of the project is [here](https://github.com/mathiasluethi/ReplicationExperiment-RegressionByEye) and the experiment we were replicating was experiment 1 from *Regression by Eye: Estimating Trends in Bivariate Visualizations*, by [Corell et al](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3025922).
