This is the last post part of the blog assignment of Quantitative HCI course of Spring Semester 2019, UZH.

Overall, the blog has a been a motivational idea that has helped me set in new R and data analysis skills.I chose this format instead of a list/index/notebook or anything else, because it suits my learning process the most.

Below I will list a series of caveats for the reader:
* The blog was not weekly because I spent ~2-3 hours per post for the most meaningful, intensive R chapters.
* The blog was mostly silent during the month of April because I was working in R in the project, using previously accumulated knowledge.
