This is the last post part of the blog assignment of Quantitative HCI course of Spring Semester 2019, UZH.Overall, the blog has a been a motivational idea that has helped me set in new R and data analysis skills.

Throughout the process,I was happy with the choice I made. I chose this format instead of a list/index/notebook or anything else, because it suits my learning process the most. I learned a lot by trying to apply the steps we did in lectures/in the videos/in the book.

Below I will list a series of caveats for the reader:
* The datasets are used only for R testing reasons and the analysis steps don't necessarily have statistical foundation.
* The blog was not weekly because I spent ~2-3 hours per post for the most meaningful, intensive R chapters. I chose to post on topics that were unfamiliar, which is why a series of introductory steps are missing. In retrospect, I should have also written those, even if I was familiar, just for enhancing the reusability of the library.
* The blog was silent during the time I was writing R for the team project, using previously accumulated knowledge. I did go back to the repository to try and reproduce certain steps for the project, which made me aware of how similar approaches for other topics I'm dealing with might be useful.

Thank you for taking the time to read my blog!
